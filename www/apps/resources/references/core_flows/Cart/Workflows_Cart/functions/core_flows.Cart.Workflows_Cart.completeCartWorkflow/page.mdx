# completeCartWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `completeCartWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow completes a cart and places an order for the customer. It's executed by the
[Complete Cart Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsidcomplete).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around completing a cart.
For example, in the [Subscriptions recipe](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/recipes/subscriptions/examples/standard#create-workflow),
this workflow is used within another workflow that creates a subscription order.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { completeCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

completeCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart/page.mdx#__type-3)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"input","type":"[CompleteCartWorkflowInput](../../../../types/core_flows.CompleteCartWorkflowInput/page.mdx)","description":"The data to complete a cart and place an order.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the cart to complete.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]},{"name":"cart","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="validate"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
